            <li>2. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or other media.</li>
            <li>3. <span class="span-text-decoration">CSS is not necessary</span> <span class="span-bg">CSS saves a lot
                    of work. </span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>

        <p class="p1">CSS Can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
            <li>External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. however,<span
                    class="span-text-decoration-2">in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>
                because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="p2">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple
            elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use
            a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>

        <p class="p3">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. Once an
            element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

        <p class="p4">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both
            are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
